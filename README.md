**AI-Based Prescription Understanding & Medical Text Simplifier**

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to convert complex medical prescriptions and clinical notes into simple, human-readable instructions. It extracts medicine names, dosage timings, and precautions, then explains them in easy language so patients can clearly understand what to take, when to take it, and what to avoid.

The system is designed for **educational and awareness purposes only** and does not provide medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. It demonstrates core AI concepts such as text preprocessing, information extraction, rule-based reasoning, and medical term mapping using Python.
